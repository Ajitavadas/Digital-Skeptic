# Digital Skeptic AI üîç

**Hackathon Mission 2: Empowering Critical Thinking in an Age of Information Overload**

A sophisticated AI-powered tool that analyzes news articles for bias, extracts key claims, and provides verification questions to enhance critical thinking and media literacy.

## üéØ Overview

The Digital Skeptic AI acts as your critical thinking partner, automating the initial analysis of news articles so you can focus your mental energy on making informed judgments. It doesn't tell you what's "true" or "false" - instead, it arms you with the right questions to ask.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- **Core Claims Extraction**: Identifies 3-5 main factual assertions
- **Language & Tone Analysis**: Analyzes writing style, bias indicators, and rhetorical techniques
- **Red Flag Detection**: Spots potential signs of bias or poor reporting
- **Verification Questions**: Generates specific, actionable questions for fact-checking

### Stand-Out Features üåü
- **Entity Recognition**: Identifies key people, organizations, and locations with investigation suggestions
- **Counter-Argument Simulation**: Presents opposing perspectives to highlight potential biases
- **Multi-Method Content Extraction**: Robust web scraping with intelligent fallbacks
- **Professional Markdown Reports**: Publication-ready analysis reports

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd digital-skeptic-ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
   ```

4. **Run the analysis**
   ```bash
   python main.py https://example.com/news-article
   ```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Analyze an article (saves to critical_analysis_report.md)
python main.py https://www.example.com/news-article

# Specify output file
python main.py https://www.example.com/news-article --output my_analysis.md

# Enable debug mode for troubleshooting
python main.py https://www.example.com/news-article --debug
```

## üìã Requirements

Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4  # Optional: defaults to gpt-4
DEBUG_MODE=false    # Optional: enable debug output
```

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Components

1. **ArticleScraper** (`article_scraper.py`)
   - Multi-method content extraction (newspaper3k + BeautifulSoup)
   - Intelligent content cleaning and normalization
   - Robust error handling and fallbacks

2. **DigitalSkepticAnalyzer** (`ai_analyzer.py`)
   - Sophisticated prompt engineering for critical analysis
   - Advanced AI reasoning for bias detection
   - Entity recognition and counter-argument generation

3. **ReportGenerator** (`report_generator.py`)
   - Professional Markdown report formatting
   - Structured output with clear sections
   - Usage guidelines and recommendations

4. **Configuration** (`config.py`)
   - Centralized settings management
   - Environment variable handling
   - Validation and error checking

### Web Scraping Approach

The tool uses a multi-layered approach to content extraction:

1. **Primary**: `newspaper3k` - Optimized for news articles
2. **Fallback**: Custom BeautifulSoup selectors
3. **Cleaning**: Content normalization and junk removal
4. **Validation**: Ensures meaningful content extraction

*Note: If you encounter web scraping issues due to anti-bot measures, you can save the article text to a local file and modify the scraper to read from the file instead.*

## üìä Sample Output

The tool generates a comprehensive Markdown report with these sections:

```markdown
# Critical Analysis Report: [Article Title]

### Core Claims
‚Ä¢ Company X reported a 25% increase in quarterly revenue
‚Ä¢ The new policy will affect over 100,000 residents
‚Ä¢ Three independent studies confirmed the correlation

### Language & Tone Analysis
The language in this article is highly persuasive and uses emotionally 
charged words like 'disastrous' and 'unprecedented' to frame the narrative...

### Potential Red Flags
‚Ä¢ The article heavily relies on a single anonymous 'insider'
‚Ä¢ Statistical data is mentioned but no source link is provided
‚Ä¢ Alternative explanations are dismissed without exploration

### Verification Questions
1. Can I find other independent reports that corroborate the insider claims?
2. Who funded the organization that published this article?
3. What do experts with opposing views say about this topic?

### Entity Investigation Guide
**PEOPLE:**
‚Ä¢ Dr. Jane Smith - Investigate her research affiliations and funding sources

**ORGANIZATIONS:**
‚Ä¢ XYZ Institute - Research their funding sources and political affiliations

### Alternative Perspective
An opposing perspective might argue that the economic data presented 
lacks important context about seasonal variations...

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"OPENAI_API_KEY is required" error**
   - Ensure your `.env` file contains a valid OpenAI API key
   - Check that the `.env` file is in the same directory as `main.py`

2. **Web scraping failures**
   - Some sites block automated access
   - Enable debug mode: `python main.py <url> --debug`
   - Consider saving article text to a file as fallback

3. **Empty or poor content extraction**
   - The tool prioritizes content quality over quantity
   - Very short articles may not generate meaningful analysis
   - Check the article URL is accessible in a browser

4. **AI analysis errors**
   - Verify your OpenAI API key has sufficient credits
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try with a different article URL

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed error messages:
```bash
python main.py https://example.com/article --debug
```

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Content Length**: Articles are truncated to 10,000 characters for optimal AI processing
- **Rate Limits**: Respects OpenAI API rate limits with retry logic
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient processing suitable for standard hardware
- **Network**: Requires internet access for article fetching and AI analysis

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Support for PDF and document analysis
- Multi-language article analysis
- Sentiment analysis and emotional tone detection
- Integration with fact-checking databases
- Batch processing for multiple articles
- Web interface for easier use
